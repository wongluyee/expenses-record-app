## Expenses Tracker

An expenses tracker built using React.

#### What I learned while building this app:
1. **Props**: pass down data
2. **useState**: set an initial state and change it depends on user's action
3. **module.css**: scoped css for specific file

#### Next things I need to do
1. Add delete feature
2. Connect it to a database
