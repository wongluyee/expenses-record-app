## Expenses Tracker

An expenses tracker built using React.

https://wongluyee.github.io/expenses-record-app/

#### What I learned while building this app:
1. **Props**: pass down data
2. **useState**: set an initial state and change it depends on user's action
3. **module.css**: scoped css for specific file
4. **Fragment**: to avoid unnecessary div

#### Things I need to do next
##### Connect it to a database
1. Show all the expenses (get request)
2. [Done] Add new expense (post request)
3. Remove an expense (delete request)
